This file will outline the proper way to format files and directories for use
in UMass Lowell Rocketry Club code repositories. As strict as some of these rules may be they
are important for keeping our code as streamline and readable as possible.
There is a good chance that our code will be in this club in some way or 
form down the line and it is important that our successors can read and
understand our code. These guidelines are subject to change.

File and directory naming guidelines:
1.  All source code file should be in the src folder.
2.  Code file names should be all lowercase and use underscores or dashes
    to separate words.\
    Ex: example_file.cpp\
    Ex: example-file.cpp
3.  All documenting files should be in markdown ( .md ) format.
4.  Directory names should be in the same format as files.
