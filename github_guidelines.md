GitHub Guidelines

This file will outline guidelines for using GitHub while writing code for the
UMass Lowell Rocketry club. As strict as some of these rules may be they
are important for keeping our code as streamline and readable as possible.
There is a good chance that our code will be in this club in some way or 
form down the line and it is important that our successors can read and
understand our code. These guidelines are subject to change.

GitHub guidelines:
1.  Any git client is acceptable, I use git bash for windows and git GitKraken.
    As UMass Lowell students who can get git hub premium for free I would 
    really recommend using GitKraken to keep track of data and to make life
    easier.
2.  Commits should have detailed comments with name and date at the top 
    describing what was changed for that commit. This is again made easier with
    GitKraken.
    Ex:\
    firstname lastname mm/dd/yyyy\
    description of changes
3.  Merges should be done correctly if needed.
4.  Please pull before you start you start editing, adding or deleting code.
